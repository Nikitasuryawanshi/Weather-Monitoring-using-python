### About Dataset:
It is time series data set with per_hour information about wether condtion at perticuler location.it records Temparature,Dew point temperture,relative humidity,wind speed,visibilty,pressure and condtions.

### In this project, I used the following Python functions to analyze the data.
#### 1.nunique() & unique()
#### 2.Value_count()
#### 3.Filtering
#### 4.groupby()
#### 5.getgroup()
#### 6.Isnull()
#### 7.rename()
#### 8.mean()
#### 9.std()
#### 10.str>containes
#### 11.And/or operator

### The commands that we used in this project :

##### * head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
##### * shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe
##### * index - This attribute provides the index of the dataframe
##### * columns - It shows the name of each column
##### * dtypes - It shows the data-type of each column
##### * unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.
##### * nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
##### * count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.
##### * value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.
##### * info() - Provides basic information about the dataframe.

### Questions are given in the project and then solved with the help of Python.

##### Q. 1)  Find all the unique 'Wind Speed' values in the data.
##### Q. 2) Find the number of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.
##### Q. 3) Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exactly 4 km/h'.
##### Q. 4) Find out all the Null Values in the data.
##### Q. 5) Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.
##### Q. 6) What is the mean 'Visibility' ?
##### Q. 7) What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure'  in this data?
##### Q. 8) What is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data ?
##### Q. 9) Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
##### Q. 10) Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24' and 'Visibility is 25'.
##### Q. 11) What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition ?
##### Q. 12) What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition ?
##### Q. 13) Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog
